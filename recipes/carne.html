    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>6 slices of Bacon</li>
        <li>4 fresh tomatillos, husks removed</li>
        <li>3 serrano peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, peeled </li>
        <li>3 cups water </li>
        <li>2 pounds flank steak, cut into 1/2-inch squares </li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>Â½ onion, chopped </li>
        <li>6 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>ground black pepper, to taste </li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into 6 wedges </li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
                Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, about 10 <br> 
                minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble the bacon and set aside.
        </li><br>
        <li>
                Combine the tomatillos, serrano peppers, garlic, and water in a small saucepan over <br> 
                medium-high heat; bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the pan <br>
                from the heat and allow to cool. Transfer the contents to a blender and blend until <br> 
                smooth. Set aside. You can skip the simmering step and blend all the ingredients raw <br>
                with a few pieces of browned flank steak if you like.
        </li><br>
        <li>
                Place a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat; cook the flank steak in the hot skillet <br> 
                until completely browned. Pour the tomatillo mixture over the beef and bring to a <br>
                boil. Stir the chicken bouillon into the mixture, and reduce heat to medium. Cover the <br>
                skillet and simmer until tender, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
        </li><br>
        <li>
                Meanwhile, heat the pinto beans in a saucepan over medium heat until warm; reduce <br>
                heat to low to keep warm until needed. Stir the bacon and pinto beans into the flank <br>
                steak mixture; divide the mixture between 6 bowls. Garnish each with onion, cilantro, <br>
                black pepper, and a lime wedge.
        </li>
    </ol>
