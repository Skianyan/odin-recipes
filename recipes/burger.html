    <p>Sample of a good burger</p><br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Ground Chuck</li>
        <li>Cheese slices</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Red Onion</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Dill Pickles</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            First, set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed <br>
            crackers, egg, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices. <br>

            Use your hands to thoroughly combine until the mixture is very smooth.
        </li><p>
        <li>
            Next, press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to <br>
            cut and divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or <br>
            skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties. Like so:<br><br>
        
            Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. <br>
            One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your <br>
            desired thickness. You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly <br>
            larger than the buns they’ll be served on since they’ll shrink a bit in <br>
            the cooking process.<br><br>
            Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press <br>
            a dent in the center of each patty, so they don’t puff up while cooking.<br>
            You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if <br>
            needed.
        </li><p>
        <li>
            Then, preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately <br>
            350-400 degrees F.

        </li>
        <li><p>
            <strong>For thick patties:</strong> Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for <br>
            a medium burger.<br>
            <strong>For thin patties:</strong> Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.<br>
            Ideally, you only want to flip your burgers once or twice during cooking.
        </li>
    </ol><p>
